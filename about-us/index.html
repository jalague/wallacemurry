	<h1> About Wallace Murry </h1>

<p>
We are a wireless phone service (you know, like that AT&T thing). <br /> And we're actually human! What could that mean? Well...

<ul><li>We don't sell your data to big advertisers to sell you more things you don't need (sorry to break it to you, but they're all doing it)</li>
  <li>We educate you to make sure you understand what a gigabyte is and where they come from (it's not that simple) </li>
 <li>We don't overcharge you and won't let you buy something you don't need </li>
  <li>Call us, get a human (not a posing robot). </li>
    <li>Tell us about your problem: a human can meet you for tea (or wherever most convenient) and help fix it. </li>
</ul>
<br />

This is a business relationship between two entities, so we ought to treat it like one.

<p>
Existing telecommunications companies relegate all people to the role of "consumers." I.e. it is the job of a person to consume their service. We believe the reverse: people produce the data that gives all apps and services value. All apps and telecommunications would not exist without people using them. Therefore, we had better respect the real boss, you.
</p>


<p>We've built a web hosting company for millions of users and consulted for engineering groups in companies ranging from startups to Fortune-100s. Before working for you, we have worked with Morgan Stanley, Apple, Microsoft and others.</p>
<p>
We can help you leave your abusive cell phone service relationship.

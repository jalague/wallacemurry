			<b>John LaGue</b> <br />
			A recent graduate from the University of San Francisco with a degree in Data Science, John is adamant about helping you save money! In college, to save money on rent in the expensive San Francisco, John literally lived in a closet! He was able to use his extra savings to fund a month long trip across 5 countries in Europe and still had money left over! He can not wait to teach other's how they too can save on their regular monthly expenses as well with just a few clicks of a button (and without living in a closet)!

		<b>James Graham</b> <br />
		James loves it when technology works for people and is committed to its realization as a tool to help people. James has started numerous businesses ranging from selling gum in middle school (which gave him the funds necessary to become an Apple iPhone Developer) to building and selling software that sped-up and secured mobile applications. It became clear to James that name-brand technology companies don't care about making it easy for seniors to use software. So James joined Wallace Murry to become an advocate for this most digitally disenfranchised group.

	<h1> About Wallace Murry </h1>

<p>
We are a wireless phone service (you know, like that AT&T thing). <br /> And we're actually human! What could that mean? Well...

<ul><li>We don't sell your data to big advertisers to sell you more things you don't need (sorry to break it to you, but they're all doing it)</li>
  <li>We educate you to make sure you understand what a gigabyte is and where they come from (it's not that simple) </li>
 <li>We don't overcharge you and won't let you buy something you don't need </li>
  <li>Call us, get a human (not a posing robot). </li>
    <li>Tell us about your problem: a human can meet you for tea (or wherever most convenient) and help fix it. </li>
</ul>
<br />

This is a business relationship between two entities, so we ought to treat it like one.

<p>
Existing telecommunications companies relegate all people to the role of "consumers." I.e. it is the job of a person to consume their service. We believe the reverse: people produce the data that gives all apps and services value. All apps and telecommunications would not exist without people using them. Therefore, we had better respect the real boss, you.
</p>


<p>We've built a web hosting company for millions of users and consulted for engineering groups in companies ranging from startups to Fortune-100s. Before working for you, we have worked with Morgan Stanley, Apple, Microsoft and others.</p>
<p>
We can help you leave your abusive cell phone service relationship.

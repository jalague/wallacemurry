## **iPhone Users:**

### Step 1: Unlock the phone and press the Home button located on the bottom of the iPhone to see all your application icons. (If you have not set up your email account on your iPhone please see How To Set up your email on your phone before continuing.)

### Step 2: Locate the Photos app (circled in red) and press it with your finger.

### Step 3: Find the Photos icon on the bottom left (circled in red) and make sure it is selected. If it is selected it will be blue. If the icon is not blue then press it with your finger to select it.
![iPhone-Step3](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/htemailpic/p5.PNG?raw=true)


### Step 4: Once the photos are selected your screen should look somewhat like this, but with different images and different bold letters (they will be your pictures and their titles).
![iPhone-Step4](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/htemailpic/p6.PNG?raw=true)


### Step 5: Now, swipe/scroll to the image(s) you would like to send. Once you can see them press the blue “Select” in the top right corner (circled in red).
![iPhone-Step5](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/htemailpic/p7.PNG?raw=true)

### Step 6: Now, select what you would like to send by tapping the image or images you want to email once with your finger.
![iPhone-Step6](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/htemailpic/p8.PNG?raw=true)

### Step 7: Once you have all the images you would like to send press the box with an arrow pointing up in the bottom left corner (circled in red).
![iPhone-Step7](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/htemailpic/p9.PNG?raw=true)

### Step 8: A similar list of apps should appear on your screen as the ones below. Tap the “Message” app with the speech bubble in the green icon (circled in red).
![iPhone-Step8](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/httextlpics/tp10.PNG?raw=true)

### Step 9: If you already have a conversation with the person that you would like to send the photos to then you can find and tap on their name. If you do not have a conversation already, then tap the blue square with pencil (circled in red) to create a new message. We will send our image to “Kate”.
![iPhone-Step9](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/httextpics/tp11.PNG?raw=true)

### Step 10: We are almost finished! Just add any text that you would like to go with the image by typing out your message (in this case “Beautiful!”). When you have finished typing your message press the blue arrow near the image (circled in red) and your image and message will be sent!

## **Android Users**:

### Step 1: Unlock the phone and press the Home button (white dot) located on the bottom of the screen to see all your application icons. (If you have not set up your email account on your iPhone please see How To set up your email on your phone before continuing.)
![Android-Step1](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/htemailpic/p12.PNG?raw=true)

### Step 2: Swipe up or to the side to locate the Photos app and tap it once to open the application.
![Android-Step1](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/htemailpic/p13.PNG?raw=true)

### Step 3: Find the image or images you would like to send by swiping up and down. Once you have found the image(s) press and hold on the image until a blue check mark appears on the image. Once one image is selected you can select more by simply tapping them (no need to hold down on the other images).
![Android-Step1](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/htemailpic/p14.PNG?raw=true)

### Step 4: Once you have selected all the images you would like, press the icon with three connected dots in the top right corner (circled in red).
![Android-Step1](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/httextpics/tp15.PNG?raw=true)

### Step 6: (Your specific device may look slightly different, but should be similar). Now we can either select an existing conversation by tapping the Contact name or create a new conversation to send the photos to. We will choose “New Message” for this demonstration.
![Android-Step1](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/httextpics/tp16.PNG?raw=true)

### Step 7: Now tap on the Contact Name (such as John) you would like to send the images to. Alternatively, you can type a phone number directly into the space beside the “To:”, if it is to a number that is not in your phone as a contact. You can also tap multiple contacts to send the image(s) as a group message to multiple phone numbers at one time.
![Android-Step1](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/httextpics/tp17.PNG?raw=true)

### Step 8: We are almost finished! If you would like to add text to the message you may tap the white space to add text (just like a normal text message). Once you have completed your message simply tap the arrow (circled in red) and the image will be sent!

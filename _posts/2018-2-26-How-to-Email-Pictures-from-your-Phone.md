### Step 3: Find the Photos icon on the bottom left (circled in red) and make sure it is selected. If it is selected it will be blue. If the icon is not blue then press it with your finger to select it.

### Step 4: Once the photos are selected your screen should look somewhat like this, but with different images and different bold letters (they will be your pictures and their titles).

### Step 5: Now, swipe/scroll to the image(s) you would like to send. Once you can see them press the blue “Select” in the top right corner (circled in red).

### Step 9: We are almost finished! Enter the email address you would like to send the picture to by taping the blank space next to “To:” and then typing using the keypad. Add a Subject and Body to your email in a similar fashion. Once you’re ready to send just tap the “Send” button in the top right corner and you are finished!

## **Android Users**:

### Step 1: Unlock the phone and press the Home button (white dot) located on the bottom of the screen to see all your application icons. (If you have not set up your email account on your iPhone please see How To set up your email on your phone before continuing.)
![Android-Step1](https://github.com/jalague/jalague.github.io/blob/master/img/htemailpic/p12.PNG?raw=true)

### Step 2: Swipe up or to the side to locate the Photos app and tap it once to open the application.

### Step 3: Find the image or images you would like to send by swiping up and down. Once you have found the image(s) press and hold on the image until a blue check mark appears on the image. Once one image is selected you can select more by simply tapping them (no need to hold down on the other images).

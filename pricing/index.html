  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The hardest thing about building an app is being instantly compared to, and measured against, billion dollar companies like Facebook by your users. Caffeine has been absolutely critical for us. Anything short of near instantaneous load time is time for your users to stop and think about using another product. The Caffeine team integrated their product for us seamlessly, efficiently, and without us having to change a thing, erasing a huge deficit in responsiveness and load time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish we had learned about it sooner, as you only have one chance to make a great impression. Caffeine has made a world of difference.

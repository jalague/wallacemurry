    <h2>Caffeine Terms of Service</h2>
    <p>Posted: October 2, 2016</p>

    <p>
        These terms of service ("Terms") cover your use and access to the services, client software and websites ("Services") provided by Caffeine Computing, Inc. Our <a target="_blank" href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect and use your information. By using our Services, you're agreeing to be bound by these Terms, and to review our <a target="_blank" href="/privacy">Privacy</a> policy. If you're using our Services for an organization, you're agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Stuff &amp; Your Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, email messages, contacts and so on ("Your Stuff"). Your Stuff is yours.  These Terms don't give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need your permission to do things like proxying your traffic and sharing it when you ask us to.   Our Services also provide you with features like HTTP fallback, notify you when network requests are timing out, and providing performance summaries.  These and other features may require our systems to access, store and analyze Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to trusted third parties we work with.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
        You're responsible for your conduct.  Content in the Services may be protected by others' intellectual property rights. Please don't copy, upload, download or share content unless you have the right to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms. With that said, we have no obligation to do so. We aren't responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please safeguard your password and/or keyfile to the Services, make sure that others don't have access to it, and keep your account information current.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, our Services are not intended for and may not be used by people under the age of 13. By using our Services, you are representing to us that you're over 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>
        Some of our Services allow you to download client software ("Software") which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we'll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Stuff</h2>
    <p>
        The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws. These Terms don't grant you any right, title or interest in the Services, others' content in the Services, Caffeine trademarks, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.
    </p>

    <h2>Copyright</h2>
    <p>
        We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported to help@caffei.net.  We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers. 

    <h2>Paid Accounts</h2>
  
    <p>
        <em>Downgrades</em>.  Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms.  If you don't pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or reduce your storage to free space levels.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Changes</em>.  We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account.
    </p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>
        You're free to stop using our Services at any time. We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time at our discretion and without notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services if you're not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in a manner that would cause us legal liability, disrupt the Services or disrupt others' use of the Services. Except for Paid Accounts, we reserve the right to terminate and delete your account if you haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.  We'll of course provide you with notice via the email address associated with your account before we do so.
    </p>

    <h2>Services "AS IS"</h2>
    <p>
        We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee.    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CAFFEINE AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES.  THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS."  WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  Some states don't allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
    </p>
    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL CAFFEINE, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT CAFFEINE HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO CAFFEINE FOR THE PAST 12 MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION. Some states don't allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
    </p>

  
    <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Caffeine with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms.  These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.
    </p>

    <h2>Waiver, Severability &amp; Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Caffeine's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.  If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.  You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void.  Caffeine may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
    </p>

    <h2>Modifications</h2>
    <p>
        We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most current version on our website.  If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to the email address associated with your account, posting on our blog or on this page).  By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
